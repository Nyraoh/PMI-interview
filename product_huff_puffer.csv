I ordered from several different places online but this one has the best service and best price overall.\nI must admit I probably use it more now that I do not smoke cigarettes at all, but now they only last two days. It's hard for me to imagine that I'm puffing THAT many more puffs then I was before. There are definitely not 2,000 puffs on any setting, because you would literally have to Puff every minute for every waking moment to use it in 2 days time.
